# EnergyFlows
This code is developed as a part of investigating energy flow visualization

There is a lack of comments in the code
The application consists of web pages and a counting server.

The webpages use p5 libraries to do graphics in javascript.

The counting server is simple but counts every http request and responds with the count corresponding to the ip-address

Feel free to get inspired and have fun!
